    """Find the length of a virtual method table.

    This function checks whether the effective address could correspond to a virtual method table
    and returns its length.

    Arguments:
        ea: The linear address of the start of the vtable.

    Options:
        end: The end address to search through. Defaults to the end of the section.
        scan: As a slight optimization when using this function to scan for vtables, setting scan
            to True will cause this function to look ahead in some cases to increase the amount of
            data that can be skipped, reducing duplication of effort between subsequent calls.

    Returns:
        A tuple (possible, length). If the address could correspond to the start of a vtable, then
        possible is True and length is the length of the vtable in words. Otherwise, if the address
        is definitely not the start of a vtable, then possible is False and length is the number of
        words that can be skipped when searching for the next vtable.
