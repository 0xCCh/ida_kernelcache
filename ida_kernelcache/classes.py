# This module defines the ClassInfo class, which stores information about a C++ class in the
# kernelcache. It also provides the function collect_class_info() to scan the kernelcache for
# information about C++ classes and populate global variables with the result.

    The result of this function call is cached in the class_info global dictionary. If this

    kernelcache. To force re-evaluation of this function, clear the class_info dictionary with

    even if the corresponding class could not be identified. This set is stored in the global
    vtables variable.

    Only Arm64 is supported at this time.

    Only top-level classes are processed. Information about nested classes is not collected.
